Welcome to SoundCard Switch

## Description

SoundCard Switch is a Gnome Shell indicator extension designed to enable users to fully disable or enable their laptop's sound card.

This is particularly useful in office environments or other public places where unexpected sounds from your computer may be disruptive.


## Prerequisites

SoundCard Switch functions by writing data to files on sysfs. Therefore, pkexec is required to execute these privileged actions.

## Installation


To install SoundCard Switch, visit the [Gnome Extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/) page, search for SoundCardSwitch, and enable it with a simple click.
